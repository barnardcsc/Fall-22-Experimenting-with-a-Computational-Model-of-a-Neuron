# Experimenting with a Computational Model of a Neuron, Fall 2022

In this workshop, participants will explore a computational model of a neuron in a Matlab LiveScript. No previous coding experience is required. Weâ€™ll discuss the origins of the model, demonstrate it, and then participants will have a chance to play with the model code and customize it and design their own experiments with it.

This workshop is taught by Gabrielle Gutierrez, PhD, Assistant Professor, Neuroscience and Behavior at Barnard College.
